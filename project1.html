          For this project, I was tasked with creating an interface that could be used by nurses and physicians
          to document patient information in order to administer better care. <br>
          I needed to include elements like current and past health, tobaco and alcohol use, family history, and immunizations.

          Sketches </h3>
          <p> To prepare for my project, I made a variety of sketches to outline the flow of information
            and how the pages would be organized. I decided on having a single, long-form page for data entry,
            with two smaller pages for adding additional details to entries.

          Wireframing </h3>
          <p> After creating several rough sketches, I created 3 wireframes in Adobe Illustrator:
            <list>
              the data entry page, where the nurse would input information about the patient
              the "edit information" page, where the nurse or physician could edit in detail existing entries about
                specific health conditions or family history
              the data presentation page, which would consolidate all of the newly entered data in a
                readable way so that the physician could easily reference items.

            </list>
